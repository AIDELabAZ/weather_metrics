In this paper we study the interrelationship between determinants of migration, conceived as a family
strategy, and the potential impact of having a migrant household member on the people left behind. Labour
migration is often related to poverty but, given its lumpy-investment nature, lack of resources may
constitute both a motivation and a hurdle to migrate. We use a cross-sectional household survey from rural
Bangladesh to test whether migration is a diversification strategy that enab

According to the NELM approach, the typical migrant is part of a rural extended family, which
dispatches members to other places of employment to generate capital and to get access to new
investment opportunities (e.g. change of technology) for the family farm.
Underlying this study is the idea that if on the one hand migration is an informal household
insurance mechanism, on the other hand it is also a form of lumpy investment, especially onerous
for households such as those in poor

Farmers in rural Ethiopia live in a climate related risk-prone
environment. The major source of climatic risk is the per-
sistent ﬂuctuation in the amount and distribution of rainfall
(Awulachew, 2006; Namara et al., 2006). The dependence
on highly variable rainfall increases farmers’ vulnerability to
shocks while also constraining them to use yield-enhancing
modern inputs. This exacerbates the vulnerability of the house-
holds to poverty and food insecurity. Poverty in Ethiopia is,

A method widely used by economists to obtain bias corrected

are variables that affect program placement but not outcome

must be correlated with the treatment decision and must not
belong to the outcome equation. These variables, if available
and identiﬁed, can be used to obtain unbiased estimates

This study investigates the impact of different soil and water conservation (SWC) technologies on the variance of crop production in Ethiopia to
determine the risk implications of the different technologies in different regions and rainfall zones. Given the production risks posed by climate
change, such information can be used by decision makers to identify appropriate agricultural practices that act as a buffer against climate change.

also smallholders, smallholder development in such countries

Sickness should make individuals less productive, but there are problems in measuring 
this effect. First, how is adult morbidity measured in a household survey? Second, how is 
the impact of morbidity on productivity inferred, if earning is partly used to improve 
health? Self-reported functional activity limitation due to illness is considered an indicator 
of morbidity for wage earners and self employed people. To deal with both the measure-

Cassava is an important staple food for over 800 million people globally [1], providing a basic
diet for people in several countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa with the highest supplier of
carbohydrates among staple crops [2]. It is also an important energy crop for bioethanol production in
several countries [3] and can grow mostly in the hotter low land tropics and also depleted soils [4].
Among cassava producing countries, Thailand is a main producer and exporter of cassava

this paper, we exploit persistent rainfall variations in India over the past 50
years to test whether farmers adjust their irrigation and crop choice deci-

adaptation and crop adaptation. However, analysis suggests that the efﬁ-

This article adds to the literature about the impact of social networks on the adoption of modern seed technologies among smallholder farmers
in developing countries. The analysis centers on the adoption of hybrid wheat and hybrid pearl millet in India. In the local context, both crops are
cultivated mainly on a subsistence basis, and they provide examples of hybrid technologies at very different diffusion stages: while hybrid wheat

Yet, productivity increases were far from uniform. While some

been identiﬁed as one of the most important natural resources and somewhat different from
the rest, because it is viewed as a key to prosperity and wealth. As Marshall (1879) remarked,
water has played a crucial role in the location, function, and growth of communities.

Residential water demand has been an important topic research for a long time. We have
reviewed the main variables that can affect demand. Water price, income, or household
composition are crucial determinants of residential consumption. When analyzing the effect
of water price, most studies have shown that demand is inelastic. This conclusion allows
policymakers to use prices to achieve water savings.

Agriculture which is the main source of income for about 90% of

for solving household-level malnutrition and food insecurity, be-

pressure to clear forests for new land, a strategy known as the “Borlaug hypoth-

In many agrarian societies, seasonality is inherent in people's way of
life. Household incomes vary by season, often quite sharply.1 Household
consumption levels also vary seasonally (Chambers et al., 1981;

are driven largely by seasonal variations in income, and that lack of

Testing the Effect of Access to Formal Credit
The government of India has tightly regulated
the formal credit sector since the 1960s, con-
trolling both access to funds and the amount
which can be borrowed. It has frequently been
observed, and there is empirical evidence in
support of the hypothesis, that such access is
biased toward large farms. It is widely believed
that such differential access to formal credit un-

This paper investigates the causal eﬀect of trade on ﬁnancial ﬂows
using a historical quasi-natural experiment from the Ottoman Empire.
We use ﬂuctuations in regional rainfall within the Ottoman Empire to
capture the exogenous variation in exports from the Empire to Ger-
many, France, and the U.K., during 1859–1913. The provisionistic pol-
icy of the Ottoman Empire provides the basis for our identiﬁcation.
This policy dictates that only surplus production was allowed to be
exported. S

International migration is costly and initially only the middle class of the wealth distribution may have
both the means and incentives to migrate, which can increase inequality in the sending community.
However, the migration networks formed lower the costs for future migrants, which can in turn lower
inequality. This paper shows both theoretically and empirically that wealth has a nonlinear effect on
migration, and then examines the empirical evidence for an inverse U-shaped relations

Migrants to the United States from Mexico are found to come from the middle of the wealth
distribution when migration networks are not well developed, with the probability of migration
displaying an inverse U-shaped relationship with wealth. As community migration networks
grow, wealth becomes less of a constraint on individual migration, and the poor become more
likely to migrate. At high levels of migration prevalence we find that this migration leads to a
reduction in inequality.

of the IP relationship is far more pronounced in fixed effects than random effects profit

Tank irrigation management is at a crossroads. Tank irrigation
systems collectively operated and managed by informal local
bodies have been a dominant source of irrigation in southern
India since time immemorial. However, the agricultural area
under tank irrigation has been in retreat, especially since the
1990s, due to the decline in collective management. Concurrent
with this is the rapid dissemination of private well irrigation
systems. The percentage share of tank-irrigated agri

A bridge between bioacoustics – the study of animal sound
communication – and landscape ecology was recently built through
the formalization and conceptualization of soundscape ecology, a new
discipline for the life sciences (Farina et al., 2011a,b; Pijanowski et al.,
2011a,b). Soundscape ecology mainly aims to analyze the interactions
between ecological processes and all sounds arising from a landscape,
namely the soundscape (Pijanowski et al., 2011b). Soundscape ecology

The electricity sector is one of the sectors that are sensitive to
changing climate patterns [1]. Changes in climate patterns can lead
to shifts in the demand for electricity. Temperature changes
signiﬁcantly affect heating and cooling power requirements. For
instance, global warming will result in an increase in electricity
demand in hot summers because more refrigeration equipment
will be used. As a secondary energy, electricity is difﬁcult to store.

In sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world,
the use of modern seed varieties is essential for farmers to signif-
icantly increase their crop harvests and improve their living stan-
dards (Minten and Barrett, 2008). Nevertheless, certain groups of
farmers, notably women, have relatively low rates of adoption of
modern crop varieties and other agricultural technologies associ-
ated with increased crop yields (Peterman et al., 2010).

Because of the remarkable growth the agricultural sector has
recently experienced in many developing countries and because
of its importance for many of these economies, it is often viewed
as a possible driver of economic growth, development, and poverty
reduction for less-developed countries (von Braun et al., 1994;
Pingali and Rosegrant, 1995; Pingali, 2007; Barrett et al., 2012).
Horticulture, for example, especially with respect to high-value
crops, has been identiﬁed as one of

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship
between the commercialization of vegetables by smallholders and
their economic wellbeing in order to shed some light on the ongo-
